## Lab Questions

### 1 - How might you add more than two bits together?
You can add more than two bits by strating wiht a half adder and consecutively using full adders that feed the carryout into the next full adders as the carry in. 

### 2 - What is the importance of the XOR gate in an adder?
The importance of xor us that it allows for the ciruit to be simplfied further and reduce the cost of the cirucit. Also allowing for a half/full adder to produce the correct outputs. 

### 3 - What is the largest number a two bit adder can handle? What happens when you go over?
The largest number it can hold in binary is 11 which is 3 in decimal and when you over that when you get an overflow that cannot be represented soly releying on one adder in this case.
